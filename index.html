        <p class="animal-description">The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus),
             also known as the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk 
             in North America, is a cosmopolitan bird of prey (raptor) in the
              family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, 
              barred white underparts, and a black head. The peregrine is renowned for 
              its speed, reaching over 320 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic 
              hunting stoop (high-speed dive), making it the fastest bird in the 
              world, as well as the fastest member of the animal kingdom.
               According to a National Geographic TV program, the highest 
               measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h (242 mph).
                As is typical for bird-eating raptors, peregrine falcons 
                are sexually dimorphic,
             with females being considerably larger than males.</p>
